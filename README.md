## üîç Task Overview

**TASK 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations**  
- **Objective:** Analyze monthly revenue and order volume using SQL.
- **Tools Used:** PostgreSQL (pgAdmin 4)
- **Dataset Table:** `online_sales` (columns: `invoice_no`, `stock_code`, `description`, `quantity`, `invoice_date`, `unit_price`, `customer_id`, `country`)
- **Deliverables:** SQL script + Results Table

---

## üìä Analysis Performed

The analysis focuses on:

- Extracting `YEAR` and `MONTH` from `invoice_date`
- Calculating:
  - **Total Revenue** = `unit_price * quantity`
  - **Order Volume** = `COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_no)`
- Grouping results by year and month
- Sorting the output chronologically

## üß† SQL Logic Used

```sql
SELECT 
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP(invoice_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY HH24:MI')) AS order_year,
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_TIMESTAMP(invoice_date, 'DD-MM-YYYY HH24:MI')) AS order_month,
  SUM(unit_price * quantity) AS total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT invoice_no) AS order_volume
FROM online_sales
GROUP BY order_year, order_month
ORDER BY order_year, order_month;
